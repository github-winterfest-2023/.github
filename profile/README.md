# Welcome to GitHub Winterfest 2023

We are delighted to invite you to GitHub Winterfest 2023, where we will present three exciting projects:

* From code to cookies 🍪: A sweet and simple guide to GitHub Projects
> In this session, we’ll teach you how to use GitHub Projects to make your holiday baking easier and more fun. You’ll learn how to create a project board, add issues and pull requests, and move them across different stages of your baking pipeline.
* Fast-track your season’s greetings using GitHub and AI 🤖
> Are you finding it stressful getting all those season’s greetings in the (virtual) mail? Using automation and AI on GitHub, you can accelerate the process and make sure that all your loved ones receive a beautiful AI crafted message just in time.
* AI-powered winter whimsy: Create a poetry generator with GitHub Copilot and Codespaces ❄️
> Explore the synergy between human imagination and AI by watching as we build a winter-themed poetry generator using GitHub Copilot and Codespaces. Whether you’re a developer or a poetry enthusiast (or both!), we hope you’ll join us for this literary adventure.
